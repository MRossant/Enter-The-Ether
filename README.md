# Enter-The-Ether

# Background

The Ethereum blockchain is public by nature, meaning all transactions can be seen by anyone, however, it is often difficult to compile that data and visualize the blockchain in a simple, efficient and elegant way. 

Welcome to Enter the Ether, an easy-to-understand interface on key metrics of the Ethereum blockchain. This interface will allow users to interact with key stats such as daily active volume, market capitalization, market dominance, total transactions being processed, gas fee etc... 

# Functionality & MVPs

In Enter the Ether, users will be able to:

- Toggle between key metrics such as daily active volume, current market capitalization, total transactions being processed and current gas fee.

- Visualize the data in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

- Filter the data according to timestamps (i.e. change in market capitalization over a specific timeframe).

In addition, this project will include:

- A home page describing the project and a guide on how to interact with it. 
- A button entitled "Enter the Enter" to access the interface.

[Enter-the-Ether---Wireframe-cc-Premium (1).pdf](https://github.com/MRossant/Enter-The-Ether/files/7307736/Enter-the-Ether---Wireframe-cc-Premium.1.pdf)

- Data Visualization will be on the main quadrant, this will either be a graph, a map, or plain metrics such as gas fees and market capitalization. 
- User can toggle between data types. 
- User can filter data types according to time frame.
- Nav links include links to this project's Github repo.

# Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- D3 for rendering charts.
- Etherscan API to fetch ETH blockchain data.
- Webpack to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code.
- npm to manage project dependencies.

# Implementation Timeline

- **Friday**: Tinkering around D3 and understand how to render charts. Do more research on APIs and check to see if I can get free access. 

- **Weekend (Saturday and Sunday)**: Setup the project, create the file tree structure, and get webpack up and running. Create the preliminary dashboard structure, which includes creating the necessary classes and high-level functions of the app. 

- **Monday**: Ensure I can get D3 to work and be able to fetch the right data from Etherscan API. Make sure the API keys are working.

- **Tuesday**: Make sure the charts render correctly when toggling through the data types. Focus on styling of the charts.

- **Wednesday**: Finish implementing user controls, brush up the styling, add the nav links. 

- **Thursday Morning**: Deploy to GitHub.
